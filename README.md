#Banking-System

This app is made to complete Task#2 of Graduate Rotational Intership Program(GRIP) of The Sparks Foundation i.e.,Basic Banking System in an android app.

I have used Java, XML, SQL and Android studio for this project

By using this app,Any user can see their bank details such as their account no, IFSC Code, Name, Phone no, email id and their current balance. And they can transfer money to other user's. Then, his/her can able see their transactions in the transaction history.
